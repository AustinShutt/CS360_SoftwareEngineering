# CS360_SoftwareEngineering

This project is written in Python. To run it, you will need to install Python from https://python.org/downloads
During installation, be sure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH"; if you forget, you can manually add pip to your PATH.

Below are all the dependencies and the commands to install them:
PyQt5: pip install PyQt5
OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
TensorFlow: pip install tensorflow
Pillow: pip install Pillow

Once all these dependencies are installed, you will need to run the script create_model.py to set up the convolutional neural network. This may take a few minutes.

After that is complete, you can start the application via __init__.py.
